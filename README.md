This is a basic to-do list application created with the Laravel framework.

Difficulties:
1. Choosing and setting up a development environment for laravel. I chose to go with Laragon.
2. Ensuring the project used the correct Laravel version. The quick build in Laragon utilizes Laravel 8.x with no way to change it. Then needed to ensure compatible PHP version.
3. Getting the application to connect to the database. Database was created automatically, but connection required changing databases default name in .env file
4. Learning to get and use data from database.

TO-DO:
1.Create pages to display all task data
2.Record creation and deletion time of tasks
3.Record when tasks where completed
4.Add css
5.Put build instructions in README
